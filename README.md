## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ IÂ´m Emiliano Ferro 


**NaturalKiller-code/NaturalKiller-code** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a student of the degree in Genomic Sciences at the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores, Juriquilla of the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico.

I like evolution, ancient DNA (aDNA) research and Biochemistry. I have worked in some projects:

In manipulation and archiving of archaeological remains in the archaeological zone of Los Remedios in Comonfort, Guanajuato.
I worked as a laboratory assistant in the Faculty of Sciences at UNAM, in the area of prokaryotes.
In the Santa Lucia project in metagenomic analysis.
Currently I am helping in the analysis of variants of old HLA samples.
